The vast majority of writers are self-employed or freelance. Permanent paid work is more common in technical author, academic or journalist roles (see separate job descriptions). Nonetheless, a determined writer can carve themselves a niche. Typical tasks include:

writing, editing and proofreading text
liaison with other professionals such as printers, photographers and artists
marketing and distributing work
researching and developing contacts
seeking publishing contracts
negotiating terms and conditions of contracts
general administration.
High salaries are not common among writers, and most people choose the role because of the joint benefits of being their own boss and doing something they enjoy. However, some writers, particularly those who have had their work adapted for the big screen, have gone on to earn respectable sums.

Typical employers of writers
Publishers
Newspapers and magazines
Radio or television dramas
Computer games developers
Film studios
Many successful writers find work by building up contacts in the field they wish to move into. An agent can be employed to provide advice and to help secure contracts. Useful publications include Writers' Forum, The Writers' & Artists' Yearbook and The Writer's Handbook as well as their online equivalents.

Qualifications and training required
You can become a writer as a university graduate or a school leaver as there are no formal academic qualifications needed. Previous experience from published articles, freelance work or writing competitions can be useful, although not essential. A wide variety of institutions including universities, colleges and adult education centres offer short creative writing courses that can be helpful.
