Web developers are a type of software developer. They specialise in using web technologies, which they use to create websites and web applications (website components that carry out a function for the user, such as email, instant messaging, online banking and online retail).

Web developers are different to web designers, who focus more on designing the user interface of websites and web applications.

Typical responsibilities of a web developer include:

discussing clientsâ€™ requirements and proposed solutions with a senior developer (for developers at mid-skill level and below)
implementing new designs
using development tools to write and test code to develop solutions
applying off-page SEO (search engine optimisation)
managing and uploading website content
Typical employers of web developers

digital marketing agencies
retailers
the government
any organisation that has its own website
