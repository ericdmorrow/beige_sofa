Restaurant managers are responsible for overseeing the efficient running and profitability of restaurants and for managing their employees.

More information can be found in publications such as The Caterer and British Hotelier and Restaurateur and on the Institute of Hospitality website. Networking and speculative approaches to employers are advisable, particularly for graduate training schemes with larger restaurants.

Qualifications and training required
There are routes into restaurant management for both university graduates and school leavers.

Employers may favour candidates with a relevant degree or HND in business studies, management, hospitality management or hotel and catering.

Appropriate personal qualities, practical experience and business acumen are generally regarded as being just as important as academic qualifications. Gaining practical hotel, catering, restaurant, waitressing or customer service work experience is essential.
