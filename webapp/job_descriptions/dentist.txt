Dentists are medical healthcare professionals who focus specifically on the oral and dental hygiene of their patients.

As a dentist, you will typically be examining the dental and oral hygiene of patients, and either offering advice, or carrying out surgeries. Other tasks may include:

operating technical equipment such as X-ray machines
keeping accurate records of patients’ dental structure (which may need to be used to identify individuals)
keeping up-to-date with developments in dentistry
working with a medical nurse and a medical receptionist
continuing training and specialising
You may be required to work some overtime and weekend slots, but hours tend to be a lot more regular than those of medical doctors.

Typical employers of dentists
Dentists are typically employed by the NHS or by a private practice. Dentists working for the NHS earn a basic salary of between £38,500 and £82,000. NHS dental consultants earn a basic salary between £76,000 and £102,500 per year. Salaries for an associate dentist in a private practice can be anything between £30,000 and £200,000 depending on location.

Qualifications and training required
In order to work as a dentist you will need to have a degree in dentistry approved by the General Dental Council. This is typically a five year course with high entry requirements, usually including one or two sciences. There are a few accelerated four-year courses for graduates who already have a 2.1 in subjects like chemistry or biology. Before you start work you will also be required to take a clinical aptitude test (UKCAT).
