A systems developer is a type of software developer. They develop and implement applications and programs for the backend processing systems used in businesses and organisations. Backend processing systems are the behind-the-scenes parts of software that don’t have a user interface, except for administration purposes. They are used a lot in online banking and HR systems, for example.

Typical responsibilities of a systems developer include:

discussing the client’s requirements and the proposed solution with a senior developer (for developers at mid-skill level and below)
using development tools to write and test code to develop these solutions
writing documentation and operating manuals
testing and modifying systems to ensure that they operate reliably
user training and support
responding to feedback
fault finding, diagnosing and fixing bugs
Typical employers of systems developers
Specialist software development companies
Financial services firms
Banks
Technology consultancies
Telecommunications companies
Public sector organisations
Law firms
Jobs are advertised online, by careers services and by recruitment agencies.

Qualifications and training required
To get into systems development you usually need a degree related to computer science or software development; however, a few graduate employers now take on graduates from different subject backgrounds if they show the right aptitude.

Apprenticeships in software development (which could open the door to a systems developer career once you have gained experience) are on the increase.
