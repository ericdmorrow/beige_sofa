Qualifications and training required
There are routes into this profession for both school leavers and university graduates. Graduates need a degree in a relevant subject such as mechanical, automotive or aeronautical or manufacturing engineering. A list of accredited courses is available on the Engineering Councilâ€™s website. Some employers will ask for a 2.1 degree but others will accept candidates with a 2.2 degree. Take a look at our list of engineering employers that accept 2.2 degrees.

If you are a school leaver, you may be able to enter the profession with a higher national diploma (HND) in a relevant subject such as mechanical engineering. If you are aiming for a technician role, you can achieve this with an advanced or higher apprenticeship in an appropriate subject such as manufacturing or mechanical engineering. 

Relevant work experience is useful: many employers offer final-year project work, degree sponsorship, vacation work and industrial placements which can provide valuable experience and a useful insight into the profession. Take a look at our list of engineering employers who offer industrial placements and summer internships.

Achieving chartered (CEng) status with the Engineering Council can help to demonstrate your professionalism and commitment to your field. To become chartered, you will need an accredited bachelors degree in engineering or technology, plus an appropriate masters degree (MEng) or doctorate (EngD) accredited by a professional engineering institution such as the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE). You will also be eligible with an integrated MSc. To find out more, take a look at our guide to chartership.
