Manufacturing machine operators keep the wheels of industry rolling and are a vital component in the manufacturing process.

Manufacturing machine operators (sometimes called production operators) are builders, fabricators, mechanics, craftsmen and quality assurance all rolled into one. They work with heavy machinery on the factory floor, often with computer-controlled equipment or more mechanically based machines to make sure they are set up properly, working well, and producing high-quality products in a safe environment. Machine operators make sure their machines are working at full capacity, are stocked with the necessary materials and are well maintained.

Typical tasks include:

maintaining the factory machinery
ensuring the smooth and efficient running of machines
carrying out routine maintenance
fixing machines that have broken down
ensuring enough raw materials are fed into the machines
conducting periodic checks on output efficiency
occasionally removing and packing finished products
gaining a thorough knowledge of a wide range of factory machinery and how it works
Shift work, including nights and weekends, may be required, especially when manufacturing equipment is in continual 24-hour operation.
