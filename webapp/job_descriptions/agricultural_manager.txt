Agricultural managers – also known as farm managers – are responsible for making sure that work happens on farm estates.

Agricultural managers or farm managers are responsible for the daily planning, organisation, supervision and administration of activities on farm estates. Typical responsibilities include:

forward planning
making policy decisions
budgeting and maintaining accurate financial records
organising sales and purchases of livestock, farm equipment, crops and agricultural products
handling paperwork and keeping administrative records
recruiting, training/instructing and supervising farm workers
making sure that work progresses satisfactorily
ensuring compliance with government regulations and health and safety standards
keeping an up-to-date knowledge of pests and diseases
ensuring that the farm is profitable and meets projected financial targets
organising maintenance/repair of farm property, equipment and machinery
advertising and marketing farm products or the work of the farmer
Variations in workloads relate to seasonal demands – some unsociable hours may be necessary during busy periods (eg during harvesting or lambing) and managers will be expected to deal with emergencies.

Typical employers of agricultural managers
Large farm estates and smaller farms
Research institutes
Agricultural colleges
Farm management consultancy firms
Food production/manufacturing companies
The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
Vacancies are typically advertised by specialist recruitment agencies, in local/national newspapers and trade publications (online and in print) including Farmers' Weekly, Farmers Guardian and The Scottish Farmer.

Qualifications and training required
There are no qualifications required as standard for agricultural management roles, but many managers have at least a foundation degree/HND in an agricultural, horticultural, land or animal-related subject. Entry requirements vary but can start from 48 UCAS points upwards; GCSEs/standards (or equivalent) in English, maths and science are typically needed. However, many courses accept practical experience instead of academic qualifications.

It is also possible for school leavers to start an agricultural management career by undertaking an apprenticeship in agricultural management or similar, supervised by Lantra (a body promoting land-based and environmental training courses and qualifications). Again, entry requirements vary, but there are apprenticeships for both those finishing their GCSEs/standards or A levels/highers (or equivalent).

Please note that employers traditionally value experience more than academic qualifications.
