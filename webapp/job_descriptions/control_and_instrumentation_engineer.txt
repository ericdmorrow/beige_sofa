Control and instrumentation engineers research, design, develop and install the devices and systems used in manufacturing facilities and plants.

Control and instrumentation engineers ensure that industrial equipment and machinery work safely and efficiently. They may work in an office, a laboratory, on a factory floor or all three.

Responsibilities typically include:

preparing and agreeing project budgets, timescales and specifications with clients and managers
undertaking relevant research
producing and implementing designs
creating test procedures
testing, evaluating, modifying and calibrating products and instruments
writing reports and documentation
analysing and interpreting data
collaborating with a team of scientists and engineers
providing technical support.

Qualifications and training required
There are routes into this profession for both school leavers and graduates. For graduates, a degree in electrical, electronic or mechanical engineering, computing or applied physics is normally necessary. Some employers will ask for a 2.1 degree but others will accept candidates with a 2.2 degree. Take a look at our list of engineering employers that accept 2.2 degrees.

A postgraduate qualification can be advantageous and may be necessary for some posts. A list of accredited courses is available on the Engineering Councilâ€™s website and you can read our article on engineering postgraduate options to explore your options.

If you are aiming to work in a technician role, it is possible to enter the profession with a higher national diploma (HND) or through an advanced or higher apprenticeship in an appropriate subject such as electronic engineering, electrical engineering, systems engineering or manufacturing engineering. To find out more about getting into engineering via a school leaver route, visit the engineering section of TARGETcareers, our website aimed at school leavers.

Relevant experience can be beneficial. Some employers offer final year project work, degree sponsorship, vacation work and industrial placements which can provide valuable contacts and a useful insight into the profession. Take a look at our list of engineering employers who offer industrial placements and summer internships.

Achieving chartered (CEng) status with the Engineering Council can help to demonstrate your professionalism and commitment to your field. To become chartered, you will need an accredited bachelors degree in engineering or technology, plus an appropriate masters degree (MEng) or doctorate (EngD) accredited by a professional engineering institution such as the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET). You will also be eligible with an integrated MSc. To find out more, take a look at our guide to chartership.
