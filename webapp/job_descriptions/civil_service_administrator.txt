Civil Service administrators make up a significant amount of government staff. They are responsible for most of the day-to-day management of the country.

Tasks can vary massively according to the department and your role within it. Jobs could be anything from embassy staff to a scientific research fellow. Civil servants typically advise and support government officials, and implement their policy decisions. Other jobs could include:

managing staff
debating and negotiating ideas
writing reports
research
preparing policy proposals.
While 18% of roles are based in London, a much greater number of jobs are spread throughout the country, and around the world. Salaries can range from around £14,000 up to over £60,000 for senior figures. The majority of roles are on a 9.00 am – 5.00 pm basis, but specialists may be required to keep different hours. Continual professional development and training are important and the Civil Service has its own training college.
