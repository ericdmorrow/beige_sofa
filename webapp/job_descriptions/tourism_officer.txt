Competition is intense for the small number of jobs that occur each year. Most tourism officers enter the profession as assistants. Vacancies are advertised online, by careers services, in local, regional and national newspapers and in relevant publications such as Leisure Management and Marketing Week as well as their online equivalents.

Qualifications and training required
Graduates with degrees in languages, travel, tourism, leisure, business studies, marketing, management or journalism are normally at an advantage. Relevant work experience is essential, and can be gained via seasonal or vacation employment, or by working as a volunteer or paid assistant in a tourist information centre. Experience gained in museums or information work or any commercial area (sales, marketing, retailing) can also be helpful.
