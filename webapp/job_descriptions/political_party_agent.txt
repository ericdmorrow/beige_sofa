Typical employers of political party agents

Opportunities are advertised in political party magazines, by careers services, in national newspapers, in relevant publications such as New Statesman and The House Magazine, and on websites such as Working for an MP.

Qualifications and training required
Competition for jobs is intense, so while there are no set qualifications for becoming a political party agent, employment is usually dependent on possessing a good degree. A degree in any discipline is acceptable, but preferred subjects include politics, government, public/social administration, social policy, law, history, business studies and economics.
