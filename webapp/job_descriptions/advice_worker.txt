Advice workers provide impartial and confidential information, advice, and guidance to individuals about a variety of social, financial, legal and employment problems.

An advice worker helps clients in areas such as benefits, debt and money issues, law and rights, healthcare, and education. The work is challenging and varied with duties that range from interviewing clients, assessing problems and writing reports, to mediating on a client's behalf and providing legal representation at court cases and tribunals. Other responsibilities include:

maintaining records and information systems
compiling statistics
preparing/distributing publicity materials and displays
interpreting legislation and researching cases
referral and liaison with other relevant organisations
Advice workers help people who are often in crisis situations, with very complex problems. This can make the work stressful and emotionally demanding, but at the same time rewarding if a resolution to their problems or a way forward can be found.

Typical employers of advice workers
Citizens Advice
Neighbourhood Advice Centres
The National Health Service (NHS)
Universities and other institutions
Other voluntary and charitable organisations
Vacancies are advertised in local, regional and national newspapers, and through AdviceUK and the Citizens Advice. Speculative approaches to employers are advisable, particularly for work experience placements.

Qualifications and training required
Personality and relevant experience are usually more important than qualifications, although a degree in law, counselling, guidance, psychology, education, social or community work, public administration or social sciences can be helpful.
