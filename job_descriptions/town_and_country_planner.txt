Planners manage our towns and countryside on everyone's behalf. They have to encourage development for the purpose of economic growth while at the same time protecting our environment and architectural heritage.

Their main role is to balance various needs (those of the environment, the local economy and the local population) and to come up with innovative solutions. There are also opportunities for planning support staff, who assist planners in their work.

Qualifications and training
Some positions will require or desire candidates to be a chartered Member of the Royal Town Planning Institute (MRTPI). They can do this by taking an Assessment of Professional Competence (APC). Candidates can do this via an RTPI accredited undergraduate or postgraduate degree, although only ‘combined’ degrees automatically lead to chartered membership. ‘Spatial’ and ‘specialist’ accredited degrees will require further study.

Due to the nature of the authority, it is important that applicants can drive and have access to their own transport (mileage expense paid for site visits, etc).
