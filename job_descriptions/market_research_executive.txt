Market research executives are responsible for planning, coordinating and administering market research projects.

Market research helps to identify what people do, think, buy or believe and why. It is used for new product testing, assessing customer preferences, evaluating competition and monitoring staff or customer satisfaction.

Market research executives are responsible for:

consulting clients about project requirements and objectives
designing research methods such as interviews and questionnaires
carrying out qualitative or quantitative research
agreeing timescales and budgets
supervising staff
monitoring work progress
writing reports, including client recommendations
analysing, translating and presenting results
advising clients on how they can best make use of results

Candidates are advised to apply for positions early, especially for structured graduate training schemes with larger employers. Vacancies are advertised online on TARGETjobs, on the Market Research Societyâ€™s job finder page, by careers services and in national newspapers and relevant publications including Campaign, Marketing, Marketing Week and their respective websites. Many jobs receive little advertising, so networking, job-shadowing and speculative applications are essential.

Qualifications and training required
There are routes into this profession for university graduates and school leavers.

Any degree discipline is acceptable for entry into the profession, although some employers prefer subjects that include the study of statistics. A number of institutions offer specialist postgraduate marketing qualifications, which can be advantageous. Some jobs, particularly those in industrial market research, necessitate a scientific or technical background.

Relevant work experience gained in any commercial area that requires contact with customers or the general public including retailing, sales and marketing can be beneficial. Experience of canvassing or market research interviewing is particularly useful.
