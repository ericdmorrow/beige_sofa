Qualifications and training required
It may be possible to become a TEFL/TESL teacher without a degree, though employers typically look for graduates who have approved TEFL qualifications. A degree in language, linguistics, education or English will be particularly helpful in applications.

There are two main internationally-recognised TEFL qualifications: the Cambridge CELTA (Certificate in English Language Teaching to Adults) and the Trinity College London TESOL course, commonly referred to as CertTESOL.

To teach in some countries it is necessary to hold Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) in addition to a TEFL qualification, and often at least two years' general classroom experience. Relevant work experience gained as a private tutor, language assistant or summer language school tutor can be helpful.

Key skills for TEFL/TESL teachers
Excellent spoken and written language skills, with English and foreign languages
Clear diction
Patience
Lateral thinking
Confidence
