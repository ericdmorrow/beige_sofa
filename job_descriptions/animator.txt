Animators are artists who use sequential images of drawings, puppets and models to produce films for commercials, computer games, pop music videos and websites.

Animators create films for production companies, major animation studios and computer games companies. Typical responsibilities of the job include:

working creatively to produce original and aesthetically pleasing designs and solutions
using specialist computer generation software such as Maya, Flash and After Effects
presenting designs to customers for evaluation
promoting and running the business
negotiating contracts
liaising and working effectively with other design and production staff.
Typical employers of animators

Marketing companies
When making job applications, you will need a ‘showreel’ of animated work that demonstrates your abilities to potential employers. It is vital to be proactive when seeking opportunities as vacancies are rarely advertised, so speculative applications, including direct approaches to companies by telephone, are essential. For guidance on speculative applications see our page: making speculative applications.

Bear in mind that over half of animators in the UK are self-employed. Freelance can be the way to go but it can take time and a lot of dedication to build up a reputation and get established.

Qualifications and training required
There are routes into animation for both university graduates and school leavers.

An HND (higher national diploma) or degree in a relevant subject such as film, television, photography, illustration, 3D/graphic design or computer/computer-aided engineering will prepare you for entry into the profession. A postgraduate qualification in animation will also be advantageous.
