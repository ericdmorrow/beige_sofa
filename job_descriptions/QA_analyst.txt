Quality assurance (QA) analysts are responsible for the final step in the development of a game, website or any software product before it is released to the public.

Quality assurance analysts – also known as localisation analysts and test analysts – test programs, games and any software to make sure they are reliable, fully functional and user-friendly before they are released to the public. They use a test plan to inspect thousands of lines of code to make sure they are entirely error-free. They look for flaws and weaknesses in the program, such as an unappealing interface, and report back to the developers on their findings. They may also fix any system problems or glitches and make suggestions for how to make a software program work better. They must also ensure that the software is right for the market in which it will be released, is translated into the local language and is culturally compatible.

Typical duties include:

creating a test plan
using the plan to assess functionality, performance, reliability, stability and compatibility with other systems
using the plan to hunt down and fix software bugs
looking for ways to prevent bugs from occurring in the first place
guarding against incorrect language usage, truncated text and incorrect formatting
