Clinical research associates (CRAs) organise and administer clinical trials of new or current drugs in order to assess the benefits and risks of using them.

Clinical research associates help to organise and monitor the different phases of clinical trials of drugs. Key responsibilities include:

writing drug trial methodologies (procedures)
identifying and briefing appropriate trial investigators (clinicians)
setting up and disbanding trial study centres
designing trial materials and supplying study centres with sufficient quantities
providing clinicians with instructions on how to conduct the trials
collecting and authenticating data collection forms (commonly known as case report forms)
monitoring progress throughout the duration of the trial
writing reports
Typical employers of clinical research associates
Pharmaceutical companies
Clinical contract agencies or houses
Hospital academic departments
As there is strong competition for vacancies, work experience gained using relevant scientific and analytical techniques can be useful, as can previous nursing, medical sales, pharmaceutical research and clinical laboratory work. Vacancies are advertised by specialist recruitment agencies, online, in national newspapers and in scientific journals such as Clinical Research Focus, Nursing Times, New Scientist, Nature and The Pharmaceutical Journal.

The recruitment process is likely to involve a technical interview. Read our article on technical interviews to find out what these involve and how you can tackle them.
Qualifications and training required
To become a CRA it is necessary to hold an undergraduate or postgraduate qualification in nursing, life sciences (for example, biology, microbiology, toxicology, biochemistry, or pharmacology) or medical sciences (such as physiology, immunology, medicine, anatomy or pharmacy).
