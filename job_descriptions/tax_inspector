Typical employers of tax inspectors
Tax inspectors work for the government's HMRC department. Vacancies are advertised online, by careers services and in national newspapers. Competition is intense and there is a rigorous recruitment process designed to identify graduates who possess excellent academic ability, appropriate skills and leadership potential.

Closing dates are generally November for the tax specialist graduate programme: applications should be submitted in good time. Further details about vacancies and the application process can be obtained from HMRC's website.

Qualifications and training required
It is possible for both graduates and school leavers to become tax inspectors, although it is more common for graduates to be employed in this sector. Graduates will need a good honours degree in any subject (minimum 2.2). Postgraduate qualifications and previous relevant experience are not required but are advantageous and may be rewarded with higher starting salaries.

School leavers can enter HMRC at a lower level as revenue executives and work their way up, dependent on passing the appropriate departmental/professional requirements.
