Qualifications and training required
Entry requirements vary according to the industry you are working in. For some positions, a degree or higher national diploma (HND) in any subject is acceptable. However, some employers require sector-specific degree subjects, such as chemical engineering (for the chemical or food industry) or civil engineering (for the construction industry). Other relevant subjects include computer science, physics and maths.

With the right skills, experience and knowledge, itâ€™s possible to enter the profession without a degree or HND. However, this will depend on the industry and employer. 

Previous relevant experience gained in any commercial/sales area involving contact with customers or the general public is beneficial for all prospective candidates.
