Horticultural consultants are specialist advisers who identify and assess horticultural problems and provide appropriate technical or business advice to commercial and public sector clients.

Horticultural consultants are responsible for maintaining a careful balance of flora and fauna under constantly changing conditions. Key tasks include:

developing and maintaining a set of client contacts
visiting clients on site
undertaking environmental assessments
analysing horticultural yields
designing garden plans/planting layouts
advising about tree planting schemes
planning restoration projects
organising horticultural trials
making presentations
writing technical publications, advisory leaflets and reports
attending conferences
maintaining an awareness of industry developments
undertaking research
maintaining financial and administrative records
developing, advertising and marketing services.
Variations in workloads relate to seasonal demands – some long and unsocial hours may be necessary during busy periods. Opportunities for promotion into senior consultancy positions are limited – relocation or specialisation is normally required. Many horticultural consultants work on a freelance basis, after many years of experience in other horticultural roles.

Typical employers of horticultural consultants
Specialist horticultural consultancies
Local authorities
Wildlife or heritage trusts
Commercial food processing companies
Packaging and distribution companies
Horticultural, agricultural or environmental associations
A large number of horticultural consultants are self-employed.

Jobs are advertised by careers services, in local/national newspapers and publications including Opportunities, Horticulture Week, New Scientist, Nature, Farmers Weekly and their online equivalents. Speculative applications are advisable as many posts receive little advertising. Trade directories such as the British Institute of Agricultural Consultants (BIAC) Directory may provide useful contact information.

Qualifications and training required
A degree or higher national diploma (HND) in horticulture, agriculture, soil or earth sciences, environmental science, agricultural engineering or crop/plant science is normally the minimum academic requirement for entry into the profession. A relevant postgraduate qualification may be necessary for some opportunities. 

Prior practical work experience is usually essential as vacancies attract strong competition. A full driving licence is also normally required.
