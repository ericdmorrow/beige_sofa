Investment fund managers provide financial advice and services to private and corporate clients about a range of investment matters, including buying and selling investment trusts and shares or bonds, to help these clients invest their money in the best places.

Investment fund managers work very closely with investment analysts â€“ fund managers make decisions about investments, while analysts provide them with financial information and recommendations that enable such decisions to be made.

Typical tasks include:

regularly meeting with investment analysts and company managers to discuss financial matters
researching companies
gathering information
reading financial briefings (often written by investment analysts)
making informed financial recommendations and decisions
keeping knowledge up-to-date about the UK economy, current financial news and financial markets
assessing and interpreting complicated financial information
liaising with clients.
Investment work provides high levels of responsibility, good promotional opportunities and impressive financial rewards for the most successful employees. The working hours may be less demanding than other investment roles but they are still long compared with other careers.
