UX (user experience) designers measure and optimise applications (usually web based) to improve ease of use (usability), and create the best user experience by exploring many different approaches to solve end-usersâ€™ problems. One way that a UX designer might do this is by conducting in-person user tests to observe behaviour. They then refine and tweak apps, software and websites to create products that people like and find easy to use.

A similar role is that of a UI (user interface) designer. However, UI designers focus more on designing the presentation and interactivity of a product. Some roles combine both UX and UI.

For a UX designer, typical duties include:

considering existing applications and evaluating their UX (user experience) effectiveness
considering the human-computer interaction (HCI) element of a design
using online tools, such as screen readers, to aid their research
running user testing of applications, software and websites
defining interaction models, user task flows, and UI (user interface) specifications
communicating scenarios (hypothetical users), end-to-end experiences, interaction models, and screen designs to other people working on a product
working with creative directors and visual designers to incorporate a visual or brand identity into the finished product
developing and maintaining design wireframes (basic mock-ups of applications) and specifications

Qualifications and training required
There are routes into UX design for both graduates and school leavers. Many UX jobs advertised ask for a bachelors degree in a design or computing-related subject, such as HCI (human computer interaction). To enter the profession without a degree, you could start out in another digital design role and specialise in UX when you have built up a portfolio of experience. Alternatively you could start by seeking out one of the few UX apprenticeships available.
