Qualifications and training required
Many posts will require a degree. Any discipline may be accepted, but the most relevant subjects include law, psychology, business, management, education, social/community work, public administration and sociology/social sciences. A postgraduate degree in equality and diversity, race and ethnic relations and disability studies may be helpful.

Previous relevant work experience is essential prior to entry into the profession. This can be gained by helping in a local advice centre, citizens advice bureau or students' union welfare office. Many equality and diversity officers enter the profession following a career in teaching, law, social work, housing, welfare rights, HR, health or youth/community work.

Membership with the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) offers opportunities for continuing professional development (CPD) and can help to show your commitment to your field. You can become a member by obtaining a CIPD qualification or through experience assessment, where you use your experience from the past three years to gain professional recognition.

To get into this career as a school leaver, the most likely route is to complete an apprenticeship in HR and gain experience before applying for specialist roles.
