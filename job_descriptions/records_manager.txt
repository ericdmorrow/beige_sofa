Records managers are responsible for accurately, securely and effectively managing information received and produced by a wide range of public and private sector organisations.

Records managers oversee an organisation’s records from their creation and preservation through to disposal. Typical responsibilities include:

establishing new records management systems
developing, maintaining, verifying and evaluating existing systems
overseeing the switch from paper to electronic record-keeping
writing reports and publications
dealing with enquiries and requests for information from both internal and external clients
ensuring that financial, legal or administrative requirements and regulations are complied with
ensuring that data is protected
classifying and indexing records
destroying or archiving finished data/records
ensuring that records are easily accessible when needed
providing training to staff who require access or have responsibility for maintaining records
While the role is advertised for in its own right, in some organisations the job might be combined with that of:

a project manager  (information management is a key element of project management)
an information science or management role (that often has a wider remit than record management)
an IT manager
a regulation and compliance officer or regulatory affairs manager
an archivist
Typical employers of records managers
Any organisation that handles large amounts of information may require the skills of a records manager; key sectors where you might find record managers are those where there is a great deal of regulations and supervision, such as the nuclear industry, healthcare and finance.

Most record management jobs are found with:

the NHS
technology companies
universities, higher education institutions and further education colleges
local authorities and the Civil Service
financial services organisations
construction companies, utility companies and other organisations connected with power (particularly nuclear)
pharmaceutical companies
charities, retailers and other companies that store data for marketing or consumer research purposes
Experienced record managers can also work on a freelance or consultancy basis for employers.

Vacancies are typically advertised via relevant professional organisations such as the Archives & Records Association (ARA) and the Information and Records Management Society (IRMS), jobs boards, careers services and specialist recruitment agencies.

Qualifications and training required
You usually need a degree to become a records manager. There are one or two undergraduate degrees in information management and record management accredited by the Archives & Records Association (ARA), but employers don’t usually ask for a specific subject at undergraduate level. However, it is common for them to require applicants to have a postgraduate qualification in a records, archive and/or information management specialism.

The vast majority of vacancies do require you to have gained related work experience, which you can gain through voluntary work or paid placements (bear in mind that these can be competitive to secure).

It’s also not unknown for entrants to have started out in a scientific research, technology, government or financial role and to have moved across into record management, having gained the relevant postgraduate qualification if required.
