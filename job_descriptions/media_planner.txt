producing financial and media plans and forecasts

liaising with clients, consumers and advertising staff
producing briefs for media buyers
They work closely with agency accounts staff, ensuring that campaign ideas, strategies and objectives are converted into tangible tasks. Contact with clients and colleagues is a key feature of the job.

Typical employers of media planners
Media planners are employed by advertising and media agencies. Vacancies are advertised by recruitment agencies, in national newspapers and in publications such as Campaign, The Drum, Marketing, Media Week, Marketing Week and their respective websites.

Some agencies operate graduate recruitment schemes; contact your careers service for details. Many posts aren’t advertised so speculative applications are essential – Advertisers Annual and BRAD Insight may be useful for these.

Qualifications and training required
There are routes into media planning for both university graduates and school leavers.

Any degree discipline is acceptable, although journalism, psychology, business studies, communications, media studies, marketing or management qualifications can be particularly helpful.

A good appreciation of what working within advertising involves is helpful and relevant paid or voluntary work experience is desirable. A small number of agencies offer vacation placements.
