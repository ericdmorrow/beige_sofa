Pharmacovigilance officers play a key role in the pharmaceutical industry and the development and testing of new medications. They ensure that drugs on the market are safe for patients and identify any problems.

A pharmacovigilance officer may also be called a drug safety officer. They are responsible for monitoring and reporting the effectiveness and any adverse effects or side effects of pharmaceutical products on the market in the general population and in hospitals and research trials. They must liaise closely with medical and drug company representatives, patients, doctors and other healthcare professionals to record the effectiveness of drugs and other treatments. The data is meticulously recorded, analysed and processed because the informed opinions of pharmacovigilance officers will help pharmaceutical companies maximise product safety and performance, and cut down on adverse effects.

Typical responsibilities include:

recording and reporting adverse reactions received from healthcare professionals and consumers
conducting in-depth interviews with patients and healthcare professionals
developing a thorough knowledge of products
completing periodic safety update reports on drugs and other treatments
writing and reviewing serious adverse effects reports and forms
