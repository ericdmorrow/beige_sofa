Retail pharmacists provide general healthcare advice and supply prescription and non-prescription medication to the public. A retail pharmacist works in a retail setting rather than in a hospital or GP surgery.

Retail pharmacists are responsible for dispensing and controlling both prescription and non-prescription medicine. They also advise customers on general healthcare. Retail pharmacists must work to legal and ethical guidelines.

Employment as a retail pharmacist involves:

providing advice about health issues, symptoms and medications in response to customer enquiries
recruiting, training and managing staff
processing prescriptions and dispensing medication
ordering and selling medicines and other stock
meeting medical representatives
managing budgets
keeping statistical and financial records
preparing publicity materials and displays
marketing services
Some evening and weekend work may be required.

Typical employers of retail pharmacists

Qualifications and training required
It takes five years to qualify as a pharmacist. This includes a four-year degree course (an MPharm), one yearâ€™s work experience in a clinical setting and an exam, set by the General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC). In order to practice pharmacists must be registered with the GPhC.

Relevant experience gained in any retail area involving contact with customers or the general public can be beneficial.
