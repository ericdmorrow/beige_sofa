Office managers are responsible for the efficient functioning of an office through a range of administrative, financial and managerial tasks.

Office managers essentially ensure the smooth running of an office on a day-to-day basis and may manage a team of administrative or support staff. Responsibilities typically include:

organising meetings and managing databases
booking transport and accommodation
organising company events or conferences
ordering stationery and furniture
dealing with correspondence, complaints and queries
preparing letters, presentations and reports
supervising and monitoring the work of administrative staff
managing office budgets
liaising with staff, suppliers and clients
implementing and maintaining procedures/office administrative systems
delegating tasks to junior employees
organising induction programmes for new employees
ensuring that health and safety policies are up to date
using a range of software packages
attending meetings with senior management
assisting the organisation's HR function by keeping personnel records up to date, arranging interviews and so on
However, depending on the size and structure of the organisation, the role of office manager can also be combined with another office-based job role, for example:

HR assistant
Company secretary
Facilities manager (by taking responsibility for the upkeep of the building)
Marketing assistant
Duties will often include some of the traditional duties of a PA or administrator, but the role can be more wide-ranging.

Typical employers of office managers
Any organisation with more than a few members of staff may employ an office manager. Major employers include:

hospitals
universities
financial organisations
local authorities
central government
charities
small businesses
manufacturers
Jobs are typically advertised via jobs boards and local, regional and national newspapers (online and in print) as well as by specialist recruitment agencies.

Qualifications and training required
A degree can sometimes be beneficial and this career is open to graduates from all degree disciplines. However, many employers do not specify academic qualifications as a requirement, instead stressing the importance of:

experience in an administrative role
knowledge of software packages
good interpersonal and time management skills
Previous office-based, secretarial or customer-facing work experience is essential (some employers may expect at least two years). Some employers also ask for previous experience of working within an office-based role in the same sector. Relevant experience can be gained via temporary agency work, which may in turn lead to permanent office work.
