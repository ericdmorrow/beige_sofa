Qualifications and training required
A degree or higher national diploma (HND) in any subject is acceptable for entry into the profession. However, employers prefer qualifications in subjects such as business studies/management, materials science/technology, food science/technology, textile technology, polymer science/technology, process engineering, production engineering, physics or mathematics.
