Test automation developers (also known as test automation engineers) are software developers who design and write programs that run automatic tests on new or existing software â€“ an essential part of the software development cycle. They use automation frameworks (standardised guidelines) to build these programs on and write test scripts that do the testing. Different test automation developers specialise in particular automation tools, such as Selenium.

Typical responsibilities of a test automation developer include:

designing and writing test automation scripts
using test automation frameworks
investigating problems in software as a result of testing
working with QA analysts and software developers to find solutions
Typical employers of test automation developers
Software development companies
Financial services

Qualifications and training required
You can become a test automation developer with a degree or without one. However, most jobs are advertised to those who do have degrees, usually in computer science or a related subject.

A small number of apprenticeships in test developing are available. Applicants with some experience of software testing tools, such as Selenium, may be at an advantage.
