Planning technicians, also known as assistant planning officers, provide support for planners through administrative, technical and practical work.

A crucial process in the property industry is the gaining and granting of planning permission. Planning technicians can either work in the public sector or in the private sector. Planners working for private firms consider the social, environmental, design and economic consequences of developments and advise clients as to how to be granted planning permission. In the public sector, such as in local planning authorities, planners review applications and determine local planning policies.

Planning technicians have a similar role to planners and planning and development surveyors. However, planners will have more responsibility than technicians, as planning technician is the more junior role. As such, technicians typically carry out the day-to-day support work needed to enable plannersâ€™ work.
