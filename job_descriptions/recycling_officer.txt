Typical employers of recycling officers
Recycling officers are primarily employed by local authorities (county, district, borough and metropolitan councils) to reduce domestic and industrial waste by increasing what is reused. However, there may also be positions available with charitable and educational establishments.

Publications advertising vacancies include local and national newspapers, Opportunities and theMunicipal Journal. Previous relevant paid or voluntary work experience may be necessary. Common routes into the profession often include working in a support role. Not all positions are full-time and some officers are employed on a temporary basis only.

Qualifications and training required
There are routes into becoming a recycling officer for both graduates and school leavers.

For graduates, any degree discipline is acceptable for entry into the profession, although a relevant qualification in a scientific subject such as environmental science, earth sciences, biology, chemistry or materials science may be preferred. A postgraduate qualification in waste/environmental management can be beneficial, particularly for graduates without an appropriate first degree. The Chartered Institution of Waste Management (CIWM) publishes a list of accredited degrees on its website.

It’s not always necessary to have a degree as long as school leavers have relevant work experience, for example paid or unpaid work on local environment/recycling projects. You can undertake courses while working, such as Level 1, 2 and 3 diplomas in waste management or recycling activities. Alternatively, there are often apprenticeships available in recycling and waste management – these are advertised on the government website.
