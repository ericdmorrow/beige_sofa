Qualifications and training required
You can only become a water engineer if you have a degree in a relevant subject such as chemical, civil, mechanical or environmental engineering, environmental science, geology or physical geography. Some employers will ask for a 2.1 degree but others will accept candidates with a 2.2 degree. Take a look at our list of engineering employers that accept 2.2 degrees.

A postgraduate qualification may be required for some positions, and can be beneficial for graduates without relevant first degrees. A list of accredited courses is available on the Engineering Councilâ€™s website and you can read our article on engineering postgraduate study to explore your options.

If you are aiming to work in a technician role, it is possible to enter the profession with a higher national diploma (HND) in an appropriate subject such as mechanical or civil engineering.

Achieving chartered (CEng) status with the Engineering Council can help to demonstrate your professionalism and commitment to your field. To become chartered, you will need an accredited bachelors degree in engineering or technology, plus an appropriate masters degree (MEng) or doctorate (EngD) accredited by a professional engineering institution such as the Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management (CIWEM). You will also be eligible with an integrated MSc. To find out more, take a look at our guide to chartership.
