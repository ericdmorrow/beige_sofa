Primary school teaching is rarely a 9.00 am to 3.30 pm job. Nevertheless, teaching is a very rewarding career with great employment prospects. Teachers are responsible for the delivery of all subjects, with particular emphasis on the core subjects of literacy, numeracy and science.

Typical responsibilities include:

lesson planning and preparation
checking pupils' work
attending parents' evenings
preparing for ofsted inspections
running extracurricular activities
undertaking professional development
Typical employers of primary school teachers
Primary teachers are employed within state-maintained, voluntary-controlled (such as religious-aided) and private schools. Teaching vacancies are advertised in local authority jobs lists, the Times Educational Supplement, the Guardian and local newspapers as well as their online equivalents.

Qualifications and training required
Although any degree discipline is acceptable, national curriculum relevance is expected. A science or technology background can be advantageous, as can extra skills such as music. All candidates must have GCSEs (grades A-C) in English, maths and science.

Anyone wishing to teach in state-maintained schools must have qualified teacher status (QTS) either by taking an education degree, a degree followed by a PGCE (Postgraduate or Professional Graduate Certificate in Education), School-Centred Initial Teacher Training (SCITT) or employment-based School Direct training programmes. Early applications for teacher training places to UCAS Teacher Training are advisable during the first term of your final undergraduate year.

You can also become a primary school teacher via the Teach First programme; you will need a 2.1 or better in a relevant subject, 300 UCAS points and a minimum of a grade C in maths, English and science at GCSE.
