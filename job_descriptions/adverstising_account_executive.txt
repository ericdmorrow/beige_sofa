Advertising account handlers are employed by advertising agencies to administer the accounts of a small number of clients (between one and five companies), for whom they are the key contact. They are required to know the client and understand exactly what it is that they do and what it is that they want to sell. Their responsibilities could include:

consulting clients about campaign requirements
presenting campaign pitches and costs to clients
passing proposals to appropriate media/creative staff
negotiating time-scales and budgets
monitoring work progress and keeping in contact with clients at all stages
delivering final products for review
report writing
staff supervision
financial administration
The work can be pressurised with tight deadlines. Starting salaries can range from £18,000 to £24,000 and can rise to up to £40,000 with experience. Some account executives are paid a commission as part of their salary. Promotion is normally into senior managerial positions such as account manager or managing executive.

Qualifications and training required
Any degree subject is acceptable for entry into the profession, but business, marketing, or management degrees can be particularly helpful.

It is important, however, to have a good appreciation of what working within the advertising industry involves.
